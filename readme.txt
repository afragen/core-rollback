## Usage

From the Tools menu select `Rollback Core`, select the version you wish to rollback to from the dropdown and click `Rollback`. You will be directed to the `update-core.php` page where you should see a button to `Re-install` your specified version.  If you move away from the `update-core.php` page before clicking the `Re-install` button you will have 15 seconds to return and complete the process or you will need to start over.

In multisite use the Settings menu.

**WARNING:** Downgrading WordPress Core may leave your site in an unusable state requiring a complete reinstall or a forced reinstall using WP-CLI, `wp core update --force --version=5.5.3`. It may also leave your site broken due to a plugin or theme incompatibility. **Use at your own risk.**

Rollbacks use your current locale.

PRs are welcome.
